CONVERSATION FLOW EXAMPLES
================================================================================

User: "Legal consultation"
Bot: "Great! When would you prefer? We have slots available on [dates]. How many 
people will attend?"

Bot: "Perfect! I found availability next Tuesday at 2 PM. Let me confirm your booking..."

Example 2 - Staff:
User: "What's my workload today?"
Bot: "You have 6 appointments scheduled today: 3 pending confirmation, 2 approved, 
and 1 completed. Would you like details on any specific appointment?"
User: "Tell me about the high-risk ones"
Bot: "You have 1 appointment at risk of cancellation based on client patterns. 
It's at 3 PM with John Smith. Would you like recommendations?"

Example 3 - Admin:
User: "Generate a report"
Bot: "What type of report would you like? Options include: Appointments, Users, 
Revenue, or System Usage."
User: "Appointments for December"
Bot: "I'll generate that for you. What date range exactly? And any filters?"


================================================================================
NOTE ON QUESTION PHRASING
================================================================================

The chatbot works best with:
✓ Natural language questions
✓ Variations of the same question
✓ Specific details (dates, names, numbers)
✓ Follow-up questions
✓ Clarifications

The chatbot may struggle with:
✗ Extremely technical jargon
✗ Questions about features not in the system
✗ Hypothetical scenarios
✗ Complex calculations (better for reports)
✗ Very long, complex sentences

Train the chatbot to:
1. Ask clarifying questions when needed
2. Break complex queries into steps
3. Offer alternatives when exact match isn't found
4. Suggest related features or reports
5. Know when to escalate to human support
