Now since I implement a payment or services price, currently when when i view the appointment details, the price werent there.

Also i notice that in appointments, let say i Selected Legal Consultation, but in some parts of the system it just say legal consultation, like the big letters become small, make it not like that so it looks professional. analyze both admin and client side where that parts happens.

Now i want you to copy the design of the admin sidebar and how it specifies every section/page and apply it to user sidebar. Dont literally copy it. Just the design and how it specifies.

Now in the admin sidebar, when i close it, the log out overlaps. Put an icon for logout so if a close it, only the icon shows. 

Now in the messages both in admin and user system, I want that when there is a new message it appears on the top, currently that doesnt happen, only a number. Also put a date and time in the message, like put a three dot vertically besides the message and if i click that there is a details and when i click the details the date and time, and who sent it shows.

Also i noticed that only approve and decline an appointment i have right now. But what if that appointment is completed, how do i manage it? Help me create an implementation to add it to my system both in admin and user side. Like how it will work, how will it will be connected both in admin and user side. How it works. I dont know how to explain it further or put an idea for it. But you can improve my idea, add more. Make it user friendly and professional. Make sure this changes/updates, updates the admin and user side both in backend and frontend, and connections. Make sure that when an appointment is completed, a message will be send in the users message page and email. 

Add a view button in the users action logs so user can view details of that action, same like the action logs in the admin. 

Also in the slot time in the admin, i noticed that the time is military time, dont make it military time. 

Now i want you to redesign all the messages that will be sent in the users email. As much as possible dont use colors so it will look professional. Now for the status to be highlighted just bold the status.

Now since i have a slot time in the admin, I want you to put a pop up modal message for the user that if their want appointment time has no slot, A recommendation will show in that message which shows the time that has still a slot, and make sure users can select that recommendations. 

Now for the admin, lets say as an admin i putted an unavailable date but that date has an appointment under it. Put a pop up modal message for that for the admin which says and shows the appointment that will be affected if they set this date as an unavailable. And the admin can cancel all appointments under that date, put a message for reason and admin has an option if that message will be sent to all users that will be affected, or sends a message each. 

Fix the calendar also because when i select 13 for example, but the date appears as 12.

2. Smart Slot Utilization

System analyzes booking data and shows:

Underbooked days

Overbooked days

Time slots with low or high demand

Decision value: Admin knows which days to open/close, add slots, or reduce schedule.

3. No-Show Pattern Detection

The system identifies:

Users with 2+ no-shows

Time slots with high no-show rates

Days with frequent cancellations

Decision value: Admin can require confirmation, send stronger reminders, or block chronic no-shows.

4. Demand Forecasting

Simple prediction based on past data:

Forecasted busy days

Expected slow days

Expected service demand

Decision value: Helps admin prepare staff, open extra slots, or limit some days.

5. Auto-Alerts & Recommendations

The system can automatically tell the admin:

“Tomorrow is almost full.”

“Mondays have high demand. Consider extending hours.”

“Low utilization detected on Friday afternoons.”

Decision value: Immediate guidance without manually analyzing data.

6. Appointment Quality Report

Summaries like:

Avg. appointment duration

Most cancelled service

Most completed service

Customer satisfaction (if you add rating)

Decision value: Admin knows what works and what needs improvement.

5. Cancellation Risk Notice

If the system detects high booking load:

“This day is very busy, cancellation slots may not be available later.”

Decision value: Encourages the user to choose stable slots or confirm early.
